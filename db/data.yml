    - Isn&apos;t it a remarkable coincidence almost everyone has the same religion
      as their parents? And it always just happens to be the right religion. Religions
      run in families. If we&apos;d been brought up in ancient Greece we would all
      be worshipping Zeus and Apollo. If we had been born Vikings we would be worshipping
      Wotan and Thor.<br><br>-Richard Dawkins

      an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable
      to say that one is an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn&apos;t
      have. Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or agnostic. I don&apos;t
      have the evidence to prove that God doesn&apos;t exist, but I so strongly suspect
      that he doesn&apos;t that I don&apos;t want to waste my time.<br><br>-Isaac

      slavery, the slaughter of prisoners of war, the sadistic murders of women believed
      to be witches, capital punishment for hundreds of offenses, polygamy, and cruelty
      to animals. It has been used to encourage belief in the grossest superstition

      reality to set in motion events that would lead to his own death...effectively
      committing suicide. He does this because his death will, for some or other reason,
      clear humanity&apos;s sin tally (which he, himself is keeping up in heaven).
